What will be affected (a partial list):

1. H1B, H2, E3, and PERM: The Department of Labor is shutdown. Therefore, no Labor Condition Application or Labor Certification or Prevailing Wage Determination will be issued. 
2. E-Verify: While E-Verify is not available, employers are still obligated to complete the Form I-9 process. 
3. EB-5 Immigrant Investor Regional Center Program
4. Conrad 30 J-1 doctors
5. Non-minister religious workers

What will NOT be affected (a partial list):

1. Most of USCIS petitions and applications: Because a large part of the USCIS' operations are funded by petition and application fees, most of its employees will continue to process the petitions and applications.  
2. Visa issuance at oversea embassy or consulate: Embassies and consulates will operate as long as the funding from application fees can support their operations. Therefore, visa issuance should continue for a while, though there may be delays because the fewer number of staff working at the embassies and consulates. 
3. Port of entry operations: Travelers may still enter the U.S.
